<em><big><p> In mass communication, media are the communication outlets or tools</p>
	<p>used to store and deliver information or data. The term refers to components</p>
	<p>of the mass media communications industry, such as print media, publishing,</p>
	<p> the news media, photography, cinema, broadcasting, digital media, and advertising</p></big></em>

 <h2><u>How does the media affect us?</h2></u>
<big><p>Socical media plays a big role nowadays people live by it and also get</p>
	<p>get paid off it.It's more of a career now we get influencers,contant creator and etc.</p>
	<p>Most celebs start from making 60s videos to now advertising big brands on television</p>
	<p>The media maybe a harmful place as well as a fun and can be a theoretical place</p>
	<p>reason why i'm saying so is because people get bullied on social media and that can</p>
	<p>affect your health and mentalhealth as people we not the same we can take things personal</p>
	<p>and some of us dont take it personally.The media is a place where you shouldn't expect</p>
	<p>everyone to like you because if thats the mindset you coming in with then i suggest you </p>
	<p>to stay away from the media because there will be people who will try to bring you down</p>
	<p>so help yourself and be ready for hate and love at the same time from people </p></big>

  <u><h3>What is social media?</h3></u>
	<big><p>Social media are interactive technologies that facilitate the creation</p>
		<p>and sharing of information, ideas, interests, and other forms of expression</p>
		<p>through virtual communities and networks.[1][2] While challenges to the definition</p>
		<p>of social media arise[3][4] due to the variety of stand-alone and built-in social media</p>
		 <p>services currently available, there are some common features:[2]</p>
		 <p>Users usually access social media services through web-based apps on desktops
			 <p> or download services that offer social media functionality to their mobile devices
				(e.g., smartphones and tablets). As users engage with these electronic services,
				they create highly interactive platforms which individuals, communities, and organizations can share
				, co-create, discuss, participate, and modify user-generated or self-curated content posted online
				[7][8][1] Additionally, social media are used to document memories; learn about and explore things;
				 advertise oneself; and form friendships along with the growth of ideas from the creation of blogs,
				  podcasts, videos, and gaming sites.[9] This changing relationship between humans and technology is the focus
					 of the emerging field of technological self-studies.[10] Some of the most popular social media websites,
					 with more than 100 million registered users, include Facebook (and its associated Facebook Messenger),
					 TikTok, WeChat, Instagram, QZone, Weibo, Twitter, Tumblr, Baidu Tieba, and LinkedIn.
					 Depending on interpretation, other popular platforms that are sometimes referred to as social media services
					  include YouTube, QQ, Quora, Telegram, WhatsApp, Signal, LINE, Snapchat, Pinterest, Viber, Reddit, Discord,
						 VK, Microsoft Teams, and more. Wikis are examples of collaborative content creation.
Many social media outlets differ from traditional media (e.g., print magazines and newspapers, TV, and radio broadcasting)
 in many ways, including quality,[11] reach, frequency, usability, relevancy, and permanence.
 [12] Additionally, social media outlets operate in a dialogic transmission system,
 i.e., many sources to many receivers, while traditional media outlets operate under a monologic transmission model
  (i.e., one source to many receivers). For instance, a newspaper is delivered to many subscribers and a radio station broadcasts
	the same programs to an entire city.[13]
Since the dramatic expansion of the Internet, digital media or digital rhetoric can be used to represent or identify a culture.
Studying how the rhetoric that exists in the digital environment has become a crucial new process for many scholars.
Observers have noted a wide range of positive and negative impacts when it comes to the use of social media.
Social media can help to improve an individual's sense of connectedness with real
 or online communities and can be an effective communication (or marketing) tool for corporations, entrepreneurs, non-profit
  organizations, advocacy groups, political parties, and governments. Observers have also seen that there has been
	 a rise in social movements using social media as a tool for communicating and organizing in times of political unrest.</P>

	 <u><h2>THE INTERNET</H2></u>
		 <P>The Internet is a vast network that connects computers all over the world.</p>
			<p> Through the Internet, people can share information and communicate from anywhere with an Internet connection.</p>
			<P>Internet, a system architecture that has revolutionized communications and methods
of commerce by allowing various computer networks around the world to interconnect.
Sometimes referred to as a “network of networks,” the Internet emerged in the United States
in the 1970s but did not become visible to the general public until the early 1990s.
By 2020, approximately 4.5 billion people, or more than half of the world’s population,
 were estimated to have access to the Internet.

The Internet provides a capability so powerful and general that it can be used for almost any purpose
that depends on information, and it is accessible by every individual who connects to one of its constituent networks.
 It supports human communication via social media, electronic mail (e-mail), “chat rooms,” newsgroups, and audio and video
 transmission and allows people to work collaboratively at many different locations. It supports access to digital information
 by many applications, including the World Wide Web. The Internet has proved to be a spawning ground for a large and growing number
 of “e-businesses” (including subsidiaries of traditional “brick-and-mortar” companies) that carry out most of their sales and services
 over the Internet</p>

	<u><h2>Television</h2></u>
	 <p>Televison plays a role is our lives we get influenced by whats going on the
		 the screen we see somethinh we want it we like it and also there are things that
		 we watch on television that can also influence our behavior
		 like[skeem sami,gomora,the river and the queen etc..]those shows may play a role
			 interms of ]how to behave and also give you ideas sometimes it may not be good
			 reasons why i'm saying "not good" is because there are scenes where by they contain
			 violence such as war[guns,bombs and manymore] so that can give someone ideas
			 if they not in good terms with someone how to solve the problem and its not good
			 but at the end they always have a lesson after that and alot more.</p>

			 <p>Television, sometimes shortened to TV or telly, is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in black-and-white or in color, and in two or three dimensions and sound. The term can refer to a television set, a television show, or the medium of television transmission. Television is a mass medium for advertising, entertainment, news, and sports.

Television became available in crude experimental forms in the late 1920s, but it would still be several years before the new technology would be marketed to consumers. After World War II, an improved form of black-and-white television broadcasting became popular in the United Kingdom and United States, and television sets became commonplace in homes, businesses, and institutions. During the 1950s, television was the primary medium for influencing public opinion.[1] In the mid-1960s, color broadcasting was introduced in the U.S. and most other developed countries.

The availability of various types of archival storage media such as Betamax and
VHS tapes, high-capacity hard disk drives, DVDs, flash drives, high-definition Blu-ray Discs,
and cloud digital video recorders has enabled viewers to watch pre-recorded material—such as movies—at home on their own time schedule
. For many reasons, especially the convenience of remote retrieval, the storage of television and video programming now also occurs on
 the cloud (such as the video on demand service by Netflix). At the end of the first decade of the 2000s, digital television
  transmissions greatly increased in popularity. Another development was the move from
 standard-definition television (SDTV) (576i, with 576 interlaced lines of resolution and
 480i) to high-definition television (HDTV), which provides a resolution that is substantially
  higher. HDTV may be transmitted in different formats: 1080p, 1080i and 720p. Since 2010, with
	the invention of smart television, Internet television has increased the availability of television programs and movies via
	 the Internet through streaming video services such as Netflix, Amazon Video, iPlayer and Hulu.
In 2013, 79% of the world's households owned a television set.[2] The replacement of earlier bulky, high-voltage cathode ray tube (CRT)
 screen displays with compact, energy-efficient, flat-panel alternative technologies such as LCDs (both fluorescent-backlit and LED),
  OLED displays, and plasma displays was a hardware revolution that began with computer monitors in the late 1990s. Most television
	sets sold in the 2000s were flat-panel, mainly LEDs. Major manufacturers announced the discontinuation of CRT, DLP, plasma, and
	even fluorescent-backlit LCDs by the mid-2010s.[3][4] In the near future, LEDs are expected to be gradually replaced by OLEDs.
	[5] Also, major manufacturers have announced that they will increasingly produce smart TVs in the mid-2010s.[6][7][8]
	Smart TVs with integrated Internet and Web 2.0 functions became the dominant form of television by the late 2010s.[9]
Television signals were initially distributed only as terrestrial television using high-powered radio-frequency television
transmitters to broadcast the signal to individual television receivers. Alternatively television signals are distributed by
 coaxial cable or optical fiber, satellite systems and, since the 2000s via the Internet. Until the early 2000s, these were
 transmitted as analog signals, but a transition to digital television was expected to be completed worldwide by the late
  2010s A standard television set consists of multiple internal electronic circuits, including a tuner for receiving and
	 decoding broadcast signals. A visual display device which lacks a tuner is correctly called a video monitor rather than
	  a television.</p>

	  <u><h2>Radio</h2></u>
		<p>One thing we dont pay much attention to is the radio we often listening to our
			airpods and listen to music. Radio is also another platform where it can Alsoharm you and we tend
			to ignore that because we dont pay much attention to it like before back in the days
			radio is a place where you can actually get heard more especially upcomimg celebrities
			it's where you can be best promoted and also one thing about the radio is that you will
			always trend for good reasons or bad reasons so thats why you always ahve to be careful
			of your movements or the way you do things espcially celebs they buisness is always
			on the media can be rumours or the truth but still you always have to be ready
			for whats comimg nowadays especially one little worong and you trending.</p>

		 <p>Radio is the technology of signaling and communicating using radio waves.
			 [1][2][3] Radio waves are electromagnetic waves of frequency between 30 hertz (Hz) and 300 gigahertz (GHz).
			 They are generated by an electronic device called a transmitter connected to an antenna which radiates the waves, and received
			  by another antenna connected to a radio receiver. Radio is very widely used in modern technology, in radio communication,
				radar, radio navigation, remote control, remote sensing, and other applications.
In radio communication, used in radio and television broadcasting, cell phones, two-way radios, wireless networking,
and satellite communication, among numerous other uses, radio waves are used to carry information across space from a
 transmitter to a receiver, by modulating the radio signal (impressing an information signal on the radio wave by varying
  some aspect of the wave) in the transmitter. In radar, used to locate and track objects like aircraft, ships, spacecraft
	and missiles, a beam of radio waves emitted by a radar transmitter reflects off the target object, and the reflected waves
	reveal the object's location. In radio navigation systems such as GPS and VOR, a mobile receiver accepts radio signals from
	navigational radio beacons whose position is known, and by precisely measuring the arrival time of the radio waves the
	receiver can calculate its position on Earth. In wireless radio remote control devices like drones, garage door openers
	, and keyless entry systems, radio signals transmitted from a controller device control the actions of a remote device.
Applications of radio waves that do not involve transmitting the waves significant distances, such as RF heating used in industrial
processes and microwave ovens, and medical uses such as diathermy and MRI machines, are not usually called radio. The noun radio is
also used to mean a broadcast radio receiver.
Radio waves were first identified and studied by German physicist Heinrich Hertz in 1886.
 The first practical radio transmitters and receivers were developed around 1895–1896 by Italian Guglielmo Marconi,
  and radio began to be used commercially around 1900. To prevent interference between users,
	the emission of radio waves is regulated by law, coordinated by an international body called
	the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), which allocates frequency bands in the radio spectrum for different uses.</p>

<p>Radio was unique as a form of mass media because it had the potential to reach anyone, even the illiterate.
	 Radio news in the 1930s and 1940s brought the emotional impact of traumatic events home to the listening
	  public in a way that gave the nation a sense of unity.
Radio encouraged the growth of national popular music stars and brought regional
 sounds to wider audiences. The effects of early radio programs can be felt both in modern popular
 music and in television programming.
The Fairness Doctrine was created to ensure fair coverage of issues over the airwaves. It stated
 that radio stations must give equal time to contrasting points of view on an issue. An enormous
  rise in the popularity of AM talk radio occurred after the repeal of the Fairness Doctrine in 1987.
The need for radio stations to generate revenue places practical limits on what radio personalities
 can say on the air. Shock jocks like Howard Stern and Don Imus test, and sometimes exceed, these
  limits and become controversial figures, highlighting the tension between freedom of speech and
	the need for businesses to be profitable.</p>

<u><h2>Newspaper</h2></u>
	<p>A newspaper is a periodical publication containing written information about current events and is often typed in black ink with a white or gray background.
Newspapers can cover a wide variety of fields such as politics, business, sports and art, and often include materials such as opinion columns, weather forecasts,
reviews of local services, obituaries, birth notices, crosswords, editorial cartoons, comic strips, and advice columns.
Most newspapers are businesses, and they pay their expenses with a mixture of subscription
revenue, newsstand sales, and advertising revenue. The journalism organizations that publish
 newspapers are themselves often metonymically called newspapers.
Newspapers have traditionally been published in print (usually on cheap,
 low-grade paper called newsprint). However, today most newspapers are also published
 on websites as online newspapers, and some have even abandoned their print versions entirely.
Newspapers developed in the 17th century, as information sheets for merchants. By the early
19th century, many cities in Europe, as well as North and South America, published newspapers.
Some newspapers with high editorial independence, high journalism quality,
large circulation are viewed as newspapers of record.</p>
<p>Newspapers have traditionally been an important part of civil society, providing information to citizens, convening groups around events and issues, and serving as a watchdog against abuses by those in power. The decline of traditional newspaper journalism and patterns within the business of media have all been well documented. The Federal Communications Commission described these dynamics in its comprehensive 2011 report “Information Needs of Communities.” If newspapers played an important part in civic engagement and democracy, should their decline concern us? It has long been asserted by
	media members and commentators that newspapers are a vital ingredient in American community life,
	but what do the data say? Political science research experiments have sometimes found that there is
	 no necessary connection between political participation and newspaper exposure, but the topic
	 continues to be explored from different angles.Internet optimists point to evidence that shows how digital engagement has led to a major increase in political activity on social media sites, and news — not newspapers, per se — is the key to fostering robust civic life. Others go further, arguing that those who lament the loss of traditional media not only underestimate the power of the Internet, but also view old media through rose-tinted glasses. Still, increased competition for audiences has led to increasing polarization, as news outlets resort to increasingly sensationalist and controversial tactics. And evidence from the Pew Research Center has suggested that declining resources may have impacted journalists’ ability to act as honest brokers between politicians and the public.
A 2014 study published in Political Communication, “Dead Newspapers and Citizens’
Civic Engagement,” attempts to quantify the larger impacts of declining print media on
society. The author, Lee Shaker of Portland State University, used data from the 2008 and 2009
 Current Population Survey (CPS) to assess the year-over-year change in civic engagement in 18 of the largest
 metropolitan areas in the United States. In the cities examined, two lost major newspapers around that time:
  The Seattle Post-Intelligencer, founded in 1863, went online-only, while the Rocky Mountain News, established in 1859,
	 was shuttered by the E.W. Scripps chain in 2009.
By comparing civic engagement in Denver and Seattle to that in the 16 other metropolitan areas,
the study attempts to isolate the impact of newspaper closures from other possible confounding variables
. Shaker explicitly controlled for levels of unemployment and campaign advertising in the 2008 election,
 as both varied from city to city and had potential impacts on civic engagement.
The study’s findings include:
At the national and local level there is a positive relationship between newspaper readership and civic engagement as measured
by contacting or visiting a public official, buying or boycotting certain products or services
because of political or social values, and participating in local groups or civic organizations
 such as the PTA or neighborhood watch.
Measures of civic engagement in Denver and Seattle declined between 2008 and 2009. In Denver,
 four out of the five civic-engagement indicators declined significantly between 2008 and 2009,
 and Seattle saw declines in two out of five engagement categories.
In the other metropolitan areas studied almost none showed a statistically significant change in
 civic engagement. One measure, boycotting goods and services, declined significantly in Cincinnati
 while four indicators in different areas increased in that city.
At a national level, civic engagement did decline between 2008 and 2009, but less
so than observed in Denver and Seattle.
The Seattle Post-Intelligencer served a small readership before its closure — 8% of
 households compared with 20% for the Denver Rocky Mountain News — and maintained an
  online presence after the closure of the print edition. This may explain the greater
	decline in civic engagement in Denver compared with Seattle.
Declines in circulation in Denver and Seattle were no worse than nationwide trends and levels of civic
 engagement in the communities were relatively high, adding weight to the theory that the newspaper closures
 led to a decline in civic engagement, not the other way around.
“The advent of new communication opportunities suggests that new forms of engagement will also develop,
” Shaker writes in the conclusion, but he notes that “there are many questions about the importance of place
online: For example, why should any one place matter when we may all be virtual and interconnected? And yet our
 society is still geographically organized and governed. Ultimately, if we desire healthy and productive democratic communities,
  then the provisioning of local news — which helps tie citizens to each other and their communities — must continue.”</p>

	<u><h2>Magazines</h2></u>
	<p>A magazine is a periodical publication which is printed in gloss-coated and matte paper.
		Magazines are generally published on a regular schedule and contain a variety of content.
		They are generally financed by advertising, by a purchase price, by prepaid subscriptions,
		 or by a combination of the three.</p>
		 <p>magazine, also called periodical, a printed or digitally published collection of texts
			(essays, articles, stories, poems), often illustrated, that is produced at regular intervals
		 (excluding newspapers). A brief treatment of magazines follows. For full treatment,
		 see publishing: Magazine publishing.The modern magazine has its roots in early printed pamphlets,
	 broadsides, chapbooks, and almanacs, a few of which gradually began appearing at regular intervals. The earliest magazines collected a variety of material designed to appeal to particular interests. One of the earliest ones was a German publication, Erbauliche Monaths-Unterredungen (“Edifying Monthly Discussions”), which was issued periodically from 1663 to 1668. Other learned journals soon appeared in France, England, and Italy, and in the early 1670s lighter and more entertaining magazines began to appear, beginning with Le Mercure Galant (1672; later renamed Mercure de France) in France. In the early 18th century, Joseph Addison and Richard Steele brought out The Tatler (1709–11; published three times weekly) and The Spectator (1711–12, 1714; published daily). These influential periodicals contained essays on matters political and topical that continue to be regarded as examples of some of the finest English prose written. Other critical reviews treating literary and political issues also started up in the mid-1700s throughout western Europe, and at the end
	 of the century specialized periodicals began appearing, devoted to particular fields of intellectual
	  interest, such as archaeology, botany, or philosophy.
Magazines on display in a store in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. There are more than 1300 English and French magazines
 that are published in Canada.

Magazines: Fact or Fiction?
Test your knowledge of magazines with this fact-or-fiction quiz about the magazine industry’s history.
By the early 19th century a different, less learned audience had been identified, and new types
 of magazines for entertainment and family enjoyment began to appear, among them the popular weekly, the women’s
  weekly, the religious and missionary review, the illustrated magazine, and the children’s weekly.
	Their growth was stimulated by the general public’s broader interest in social and political affairs and by
	 the middle and lower classes’ growing demand, in both cities and rural areas, for reading matter.
	  Woodcuts and engravings were first extensively used by the weekly
Illustrated London News (1842), and by the end of the 19th century many magazines were illustrated.

Magazine publishing benefited in the late 19th and 20th centuries from a number of technical improvements
, including the production of inexpensive paper, the invention of the rotary press and
the halftone block, and, especially, the addition of advertisements as a means of financial support.
Other developments since then have included a greater specialization of topics; more illustrations,
especially those reproducing colour photographs; a decline in power and popularity of the critical review and
 a rise in that of the mass-market magazine; and an increase in magazines for women.

With the rise of the Internet in the late 20th century, more and more magazines put versions of their material online.
 During this time, other types of magazines became increasingly popular. These included electronic magazines,
 known as e-zines or zines. Often of casual design and produced by at most a few people, e-zines tended to be highly personal
 and irreverent. Another kind of magazine was the fanzine, which was generally produced for fans of a sport or a particular
 celebrity, among other subjects.
Technological advancements, however, also had a downside for the magazine industry.
As people had easier—and often free—access to a wealth of content, traditional magazines faced declining readership.
 In addition, ad revenue dropped as advertisers increasingly turned to other online outlets.
 Such factors contributed to a number of magazines folding in the early 21st century,
  while others were forced to discontinue print editions and publish only digital versions.</p>
